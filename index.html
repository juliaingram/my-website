            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Julia! I'm a master's student in Columbia's data journalism program.</p>
            <p>I'm originally from NYC, and I graduated last year from Stanford University, where I studied English and edited and wrote for the student newspaper, The Stanford Daily. Over the past few summers, I've interned at The Washington Post, NBC News and the Miami Herald.
                My foray into data journalism was a collaborative project with <a href="https://biglocalnews.org/#/">Big Local News</a> last year to collect K-12 school data from as many states as possible to look at how the pandemic impacted school enrollment.
